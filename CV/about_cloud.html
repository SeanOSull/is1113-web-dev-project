        	    <h1>Platform as a Service (PaaS) - Cloud 9</h1>
        	    <h3>
 - Platform as a service also known as PaaS is a cloud computing model in which a certaim provider delivers hardware and software tools which are needed for application development to users via the internet
- The main benefit of PaaS is that it liberates users from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application.

- some advantages of Paas include: (1) PaaS development tools can cut the time it takes to code new apps with pre-coded 
application components built into the platform, such as workflow, directory services, security features, search, and many more.
(2)Develop for multiple platforms—including mobile—more easily. (3)PaaS provides all of the capabilities that you need to support 
the complete web application lifecycle: building, testing, deploying, managing, and updating.</h3>

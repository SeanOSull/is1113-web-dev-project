        	    Cloud 9 allows user to edit the same code real-time which would contribute to projects being done by developers or users in quicker time saving time so they
        	    could work on other projects. <br> Cloud 9 also allows users to chat and discuss their code so they may overcome any problems they many be having, which would lead to
